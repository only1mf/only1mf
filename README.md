Hi, I’m @only1mf
I’m interested in tackling big, chaotic projects :)
I’m currently learning how to be a better human (it's a work in progress).
I’m a DigiMark student with a strong foundation in C#, CSS, HTML, and some experience with C++ and JavaScript.
I’m open to collaborating on cheats and other wild projects—just slide into my DMs.
Reach me on Discord: .only1mf
⚡ Fun fact: I live outside... not by choice.
